GITWEBBY UPDATE SCRIPT
STARTING LOCAL DEPLOYMENT OF A WEB BROWSABLE VERSION OF YOUR SOURCE CODE
GIT REPOSITORIES.

1. PARSE ARG ENV VARS
OPT ARG --proj=0 is the first command argument and it is optional
- --proj=1 means there is 1 folder in between the root of the repo dirs
...and the individual repo dirs.
- --proj=2 means there are 2 folders in between the root of the repo dirs
...and the individual repo dirs.
1ST PATH ARG is required and it is the path to your root of repositories
...and must have n (from --proj=n, omitted default is 0) directories in-
...between the root and an actual repository directory. The root folder
...name will be the display name above your list of repositories in the
...GitWebby UI.
2ND PATH ARG is required and is the path to your local gitwebby instance
...(gitwebby code repository).
- GITWEBBY_FORCE env var, 1 means force all files to write without skipping
- GITWEBBY_REMOTE env var, 1 means to include remote branches
- GITWEBBY_1BRANCH env var, 1 means to only process 1 branch per repo
2. DEFINE PROGRAM VARS
- bt, back-tick
- btrepl, back-tick replacement unique id tag
- datdir, data dir
- dotdir, .gitwebby dir
- n, --proj=n number of intermediary directories between root and repo
- rpd, repository list directory (arg1)
- rtd, return directory (in case running as source script)
- upd, update directory (arg2)
- vt, vertical-tab
- vtrepl, vertical-tab replacement unique id tag
...
... DONE

FIND REPO LIST NAME
1. CREATE .gitwebby/lkp/dc FOLDER HIERARCHY
2. EMPTY .gitwebby/repos.txt FILE
3. repolistnm = BASE NAME OF rpd
4. STORE repolistnm IN data/repo-list.js FILE
...
... DONE

FIND REPO PATHS
np1 IS n (--proj=n) PLUS 1
TRAVERSAL: lst STARTS AS ls rpd
i IS 0
WHILE i IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO np1
...ITERATE dir AS ls lst
......IF i IS n THEN ADD TO REPO-LIST
......ELSE APPEND ls dir TO lst
...
... DONE

FIND BRANCHES
FOR fullp IN .gitwebby/repo-paths.txt
...branches = LIST BRANCHES IN fullp (git branch)
...mbranch = CURRENT BRANCH IN fullp (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
...norm_name IS NORMALIZED fullp THAT CAN BE SAVED AS A FILENAME
...mb_lkp IS MAIN BRANCH LOOKUP STORED IN .gitwebby/lkp/mb/norm_name.txt
...ab_lkp IS ALL BRANCH LOOKUP STORED IN .gitwebby/lkp/ab/norm_name.txt
...LOOKUP IS CREATED WITH CONTENT: fullp TAB {mbranch|branches}
...
... DONE

FIND COMMITS
FOR ab IN .gitwebby/lkp/ab/*.txt
...EXTRACT branches FROM FILE
...FOR b in branches
......tab VAR IS TAB
......commits (git log b --pretty=format:%H$tab%an$tab%aI$tab%s)
......CREATE LOOKUP .gitwebby/lkp/cmmt/trick-or-squeak..txt
...
... DONE

FIND FILES, WRITE JS FOR MANIFESTS
... DONE

WRITE FILE CONTENTS TO DATA JS FILES
EXCEPT FOR NON-TEXT FILES
(THE `file --list` COMMAND SHOWS SOURCE CODE FILES ARE REPORTED WITH
'text' IN THE OUTPUT WHEN RUNNING `file filename` SO WE DETERMINE
IF IT IS A TEXT FILE BY SEARCHING FOR 'text' IN THE OUTPUT OF THE file
COMMAND)
WITH THE FOLLOWING STRING REPLACEMENTS
0. btrepl VARIABLE IS A UNIQUE ID UNLIKELY TO BE FOUND IN SOURCE CODE
a. vtrepl VARIABLE IS A UNIQUE ID UNLIKELY TO BE FOUND IN SOURCE CODE
1. FCS = [F]ILE [C]ONTENT [S]TRING
a. FCS REPLACE ` WITH ${btrepl}
b. FCS REPLACE ${ WITH $ ${btrepl} {
2. [T]EMPLATE [C]ONTENT [S]TRING = `FCS`
a. TCS.replaceAll(${btrepl}, `)
b. TCS.replaceAll(${vtrepl}, '')

WRITE INFO FOR REPOS LIST

WRITE JS FOR REPOS LIST

PROCESS DIFFS BY PARSING COMMIT DIFFS AND
